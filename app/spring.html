<p class="tit">7. TRANSFERENCE AND COUNTERTRANSFERENCE</p>
<p class="aut">Dr Spyros Karvounis</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Date</strong> Thursday 23 January</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Time</strong> 7.30pm-9.30pm</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Cost</strong> £20</p>
<p class="aut">Subjects covered:</p> 
<p class="bib">Psychopathology, Fairy Tale & Myth, Individuation, Transference and Countertransference, Jungian and Post-Jungian Theory and Practice</p>
<p class="det">The aim of the seminar is to approach transference phenomena from different angles: as an expression of the dialectical development of the objective psyche, as a dynamic element between two people in the therapy room and finally as a constant movement of development between them. In examining the complexity of transference phenomena, traditional Jungian and post-Jungian approaches will be juxtaposed.</p>

<p class="tit">8. AN INTRODUCTION TO DEVELOPMENTAL THEORIES OF THE MIND: THEIR RELEVANCE AND APPLICATION</p>
<p class="aut">Katerina Sarafidou</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Date</strong> Friday 24 January, Saturday 25 January</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Time</strong> Friday 7.30-9.30pm, Saturday 10.30am-12.30pm, 2pm-4pm</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Cost</strong> £105</p>
<p class="aut">Subjects covered:</p> 
<p class="bib">Developmental Models, Psychopathology, Fundamentals</p>
<p class="det">These seminars aim to provide an overview of developmental approaches to the understanding of the emergence of the self and mind. This will include key intra-psychic and relational perspectives and will cover an introduction to various expressions of object relations theories, post-Jungian developmental theories as well as attachment theory and neuroscience. The seminars will examine the emergence and interrelationship of these approaches, their joint application to clinical practice, and their implications for the understanding of pathology and the analytic task. Their relevance for analytical psychology and the Jungian model of the psyche will also be considered.</p>

<p class="aut">Maggie Stanway</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Date</strong> Thursday 27 February</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Time</strong> 7.30-9.30pm</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Cost</strong> £20</p>
<p class="aut">Subjects covered:</p> <p class="bib">Fairy Tale and Myth, Fundamentals</p>
<p class="det">Instigated by the horror of situations he encountered as a human rights lawyer, Dexter Dias spent some years researching human characteristics involved in atrocities such as female genital mutilation, slavery and war. He looked at them through the lenses of evolutionary theory and neuroscience. The resulting book, <em>The 10 Types of Human,</em> identifies ten archetypal images, such as The Ostraciser, The Aggressor, The Tamer of Terror, The Tribalist etc. The seminar will link each of Dias’s ‘10’ with Greek gods and their myths, to give perspectives which may help us to work with them. </p>

<p class="tit">10. JUNG’S COMPLEX PATH: ONE CLINICAL BEGINNING (THE WORD ASSOCIATION EXPERIMENT/EXPERIENCE)</p>
<p class="aut">Josephine Evetts-Secker</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Date</strong> Friday 28 February, Saturday 29 February</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Time</strong> Friday 7.30-9.30pm, Saturday 10.30am-12.30pm, 2pm-4pm</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Cost</strong> £105</p>
<p class="aut">Subjects Covered:</p> <p class="bib">Fundamentals, Psychopathology and History of Neurosis</p>
<p class="det"><em>‘Complexes are in truth the living units of the unconscious psyche …’</em> Jung 8, § 210</p>
<p class="det">At the Burghölzli Hospital early in his professional life, Jung began working on word association with a number of colleagues. He was convinced that this could provide direct evidence of the kind of unconscious conflicts that Freud was exploring.</p>
<p class="det">The Word Association Experiment (WAE) was the result of this research, using what we would now regard as very primitive equipment, to manifest certain behaviours scientifically. Jung devised this experiment to demonstrate the reality and autonomy of unconscious complexes. From recorded responses of participants, he could plot a ‘map’ of particular psychological charges, indicating the activation of unconscious complexes. This term, ‘complex’ was one of Jung’s earliest contributions to depth psychology that led him further in understanding archetypal energy active at the core of each complex. He insisted: “The <em>via regia</em> to the unconscious …is not the dream, as [Freud] thought, but the complex, which is the architect of dreams and symptoms”. (CW 8, § 210). The energy of such a constellation of complexes activated in the WAE directly reveals how “conscious intention is overwhelmed”. (CW 8, § 200). This illuminates the subject’s immediate psychic state, and also deepens understanding of Jung’s model, which at that time he wanted to name “complex psychology”.</p>
<p class="det">This course will follow the development through this early work and consider its continuing, potential clinical value in analysis today.</p>
<p class="aut">Reading:</p>
<p class="bib"><strong>Jung, C.G.,</strong> <em>Collected Works,</em> Vol. 2, <em>Experimental Researches,</em> §§ 1349-1356. And whatever you can of the rest of this volume but that is not essential.</p>
<p class="bib"><strong>Jung, C.G.,</strong> <em>Collected Works,</em> Vol. 8, <em>A Review of the Complex Theory,</em> §§ 194-219</p>
<p class="bib"><strong>Jung, C.G.,</strong> <em>Collected Works,</em> Vol. 7, <em>Two Essays on Analytical Psychology.</em> Look at the Psychology of Unconscious Processes.</p>
<p class="bib">Further reading (post-Jungian) will be suggested when we are more deeply involved with the issues raised in the introductory lectures.</p>

<p class="tit">11. MATTER AND SPIRIT: A VISIONARY COMBINATION?</p>
<p class="aut">Ailish O’Driscoll</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Date</strong> Thursday 26 March</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Time</strong> 7.30–9.30pm</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Cost</strong> £20</p>
<p class="aut">Subjects Covered:</p> 
<p class="bib">Fundamentals, Psychology and Religion, Alchemy, Cultural Aspects of Analytical Psychology</p>
<p class="det">Exploration of these concepts will be made by referring to work by Jung and von Franz. Consideration will be given to the relationship between matter and spirit. This will be amplified by reference to some different belief systems, such as an Irish vision of nature and alchemy among others. This methodology belongs to an analytic approach. The exploration will hopefully prepare the ground for further work on alchemy, the significance of the Assumption of the Virgin, and synchronicity.</p> 
<p class="aut">Reading:</p>
<p class="bib"><strong>Jung, C. G.,</strong> <em>Collected Works,</em> Vol. 8 <em>Spirit and Life,</em> §§ 601–648</p>

<p class="tit">12. JUNG, ALCHEMY AND THE SECOND JOURNEY OF LIFE</p>
<p class="aut">Catherine Bygott</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Date</strong> Friday 27 March, Saturday 28 March</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Time</strong> Friday 7.30-9.30pm, Saturday 10.30am-12.30pm, 2pm-4pm</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Cost</strong> £105</p>
<p class="aut">Subjects covered:</p> 
<p class="bib">Alchemy, Individuation, Fundamentals, Psychology and Religion, Cultural Aspects of Analytical Psychology</p>
<br>
<p class="det">What is the nature of life beyond the struggle to establish ego?</p>
<p class="det">How is this crossing to be made?</p>
<p class="det">Where is the ‘still point’ to be found in our turning, changing world?</p>
<br>
<p class="det">The second journey of life invites us to take ‘the road less travelled’ beyond cognitive processes of differentiating and dividing, and to recognise archetypal energies as having psychoid, as well as psychic, expression. Through this experientially oriented seminar-workshop, we will explore these questions and others, drawing on Jung’s own life journey, his psychology of opposites and the sacred mystery of alchemical transformation.</p>
