<p class="aut">Janet Atkins</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Date</strong> Thursday 23 April</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Time</strong> 7.30pm-9.30pm</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Cost</strong> £20</p>
<p class="aut">Subjects covered:</p> 
<p class="bib">Fairy Tale and Myth, Fundamentals</p>
<p class="det">This seminar will focus mainly on the story of Rapunzel, the girl locked in a high tower by an old enchantress, as told in Grimms' fairy tales. As well as looking at what this story has to say about the relationship between the young feminine and the old woman or witch, it will consider the motifs of high and low, food, hunger and satiation and the senses and the sensual, which occur in other stories where the young girl encounters the old woman.</p>

<p class="tit">14. <em>A WINTER’S TALE</em></p>
<p class="aut">Robert Macdonald</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Date</strong> Friday 24 April, Saturday 25 April</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Time</strong> Friday 7.30-9.30pm, Saturday 10.30am-12.30pm, 1.30pm-3.30pm</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Cost</strong> £105</p>
<p class="aut">Subjects covered:</p> 
<p class="bib">Individuation, Alchemy, Dreams</p>
<p class="det"><em>... this is an art<br>
Which does mend nature, change it rather, but<br>
The art itself is nature.</em><br>   
            <p class="bib"><strong><em>The Winter’s Tale</em> IV iv</strong></p> 
<p class="det">From a separation arising from homicidal jealousy, to a miraculous reconciliation arising from love, in the broad movement from darkness to light, this “sad tale best left for winter” encompasses an extreme range of emotional experience. It reiterates and develops the theme of tragic vulnerability which threads through Shakespeare’s late work. At the centre of the play lies a mystery, personified by the character of Time, who oversees a sixteen-year gap, with no clue to the experiences or processes that bring forth the hero’s transformation and his remarkable conversion from judgement to mercy.</p> 
<p class="det">This mystery will be considered with reference to the Eleusinian Mysteries, Andrea’s <em>The Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosencrutz</em>, and the emblems and epigrams from Maier’s <em>Atalanta Fugiens</em>. Jealousy and shame will be considered particularly from an archetypal-alchemical perspective. Overall the weekend will explore the symbolic and spiritual alchemy embedded in the substructure of the play, its relationship to Jung’s psychology of individuation, and (deo concendente) deeper insight into the nature of love.</p>

<p class="tit">15. ARCHETYPAL AND PERSONAL DIMENSIONS IN CLINICAL WORK: SHOULD THEY BE REGARDED AS FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT, OR TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN?</p>
<p class="aut">Mark Saban</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Date</strong> Thursday 28 May</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Time</strong> 7.30-9.30pm</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Cost</strong> £20</p>
<p class="aut">Subjects covered:</p> 
<p class="bib">Fundamentals, Individuation, Transference/Countertransference, Post-Jungian Theory and Practice</p>
<p class="det">The presenter will look at the theory and practice of Jungian analysis, with specific reference to the differentiation of archetypal dimensions from personal dimensions within clinical work. The starting point for this will be a close look at Jung’s own practice with clients and specifically with Christiana Morgan, whose active imaginations were utilised in Jung’s Visions Seminars. Jung’s way of working will be put into tension with his own concept of the Transcendent Function. The long-term influence of Jung’s approach will be examined within the context of post-Jungian theory and practice.</p>

<p class="tit">16. READING SEMINAR: JUNG: <em>THE DEVELOPMENT OF PERSONALITY</em> CW17</p>
<p class="aut">Jim Fitzgerald</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Date</strong> Friday 29 May, Saturday 30 May</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Time</strong> Friday 7.30-9.30pm, Saturday 10.30am-12.30pm and 1.30pm-3.30pm</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Cost</strong> £105</p>
<p class="aut">Subjects Covered:</p> 
<p class="bib">Fundamentals, Individuation, Cultural Aspects of Analytical Psychology</p>
<p class="det">The aim of this seminar is to provide a close reading of a key text of Jung, in which he discusses the concept of Personality. Delivered originally as a lecture in Vienna in 1932, at the time of the rise of Fascism in Europe, it explores the fundamental basis of individual identity. Jung was aware of the growing interest in the study of personality in the fields of psychology and education, particularly in the United States. Jung’s own work of 1920, <em>Psychological Types,</em> was a major contribution to the field, to which both Freud and Adler had added their contrasting input.
Jung’s particular approach is founded on his theoretical understanding of the relationship of consciousness to the unconscious, with its archetypal base. His key insight, parallel with his theory of individuation, is that true personality stems from the personal experience of vocation.</p>

<p class="tit">18. PSYCHE AND SOCIETY</p>
<p class="aut">Mariolina Graziosi</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Date</strong> Friday 26 June, Saturday 27 June</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Time</strong> Friday 7.30-9.30pm, Saturday 10.30am-12.30pm, 1.30pm-3.30pm</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Cost</strong> £105</p>
<p class="aut">Subjects covered:</p> 
<p class="bib">Fundamentals, Individuation, Alchemy</p> 
<p class="det">With the concept of the collective unconscious, C.G. Jung recognized the deep link between psyche and society. Both share the same root: that of the archetypes. As the German philosopher, Theodor Adorno states in his book, <em>Soziologische Schriften,</em> to see society and the psyche as two separate entities means to have a paranoid view. The aim of these seminars is to analyse how, through the archetypes, psyche and society are united. The question of the nature of the psyche will also be addressed: does it have an ontological foundation or it is a cultural product, or both? Finally, the relationship between the archetypes and the concept of the soul, together with their link to culture, will be investigated.</p>
