<p class="aut">Janet Atkins</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Date</strong> Thursday 23 April</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Time</strong> 7.30pm-9.30pm</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Cost</strong> £20</p>
<p class="aut">Subjects covered:</p> 
<p class="bib">Fairy Tale and Myth, Fundamentals</p>
<p class="det">This seminar will focus mainly on the story of Rapunzel, the girl locked in a high tower by an old enchantress, as told in Grimm’s fairy tales. As well as looking at what this story has to say about the relationship between the young feminine and the old woman or witch, it will consider the motifs of high and low, food, hunger and satiation, the senses and the sensual, which occur in other stories where the young girl encounters the old woman.</p>

<p class="tit">14. <em>A WINTER’S TALE</em></p>
<p class="aut">Robert MacDonald</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Date</strong> Friday 24 April, Saturday 25 April</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Time</strong> Friday 7.30-9.30pm, Saturday 10.30am-12.30pm, 2pm-4pm</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Cost</strong> £105</p>
<p class="aut">Subjects covered:</p> 
<p class="bib">Individuation, Alchemy, Dreams</p>
<p class="det">A murderous causeless jealousy operates at the heart of <em>A Winter’s Tale,</em> reiterating the theme of tragic vulnerability in the masculine psyche which threads through Shakespeare’s late work.</p> 
<p class="det">In spite of a sixteen-year isolation, his “saint-like sorrow”, and a most moving reconciliation between an estranged husband and his wife, a lack of humility in the hero remains. He laments, “I am ashamed – does not the stone rebuke me for being more stone than it.”</p>
<p class="det">What is this unredeemable aspect? What place does the timeless presence of leaden nature have in the individuation process?</p> 
<p class="det">Rage, shame, time, solitude and grace will be considered, with reference to Jung, Alchemy and Gnosticism, in pursuit of the symbolic and religious significance of this play.</p>

<p class="aut">Mark Saban</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Date</strong> Thursday 28 May</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Time</strong> 7.30-9.30pm</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Cost</strong> £20</p>
<p class="aut">Subjects covered:</p> 
<p class="bib">Fundamentals, Individuation, Transference/Countertransference, Post-Jungian Theory and Practice</p>
<p class="det">The presenter will look at the theory and practice of Jungian analysis, with specific reference to the differentiation of archetypal dimensions from personal dimensions within clinical work. The starting point for this will be a close look at Jung’s own practice with clients and specifically with Christiana Morgan, whose active imaginations were utilised in Jung’s Visions Seminars. Jung’s way of working will be put into tension with his own concept of the Transcendent Function. The long-term influence of Jung’s approach will be examined within the context of post-Jungian theory and practice.</p>

<p class="tit">16. READING SEMINAR: JUNG: THE DEVELOPMENT OF PERSONALITY CW17</p>
<p class="aut">Jim Fitzgerald</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Date</strong> Friday 29 May, Saturday 30 May</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Time</strong> Friday 7.30-9.30pm, Saturday 10.30am-12.30pm and 2pm-4pm</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Cost</strong> £105</p>
<p class="aut">Subjects Covered:</p> 
<p class="bib">Fundamentals, Individuation, Cultural Aspects of Analytical Psychology</p>
<p class="det">The aim of this seminar is to provide a close reading of a key text of Jung, in which he discusses the concept of Personality. Delivered originally as a lecture in Vienna in 1932, at the time of the rise of Fascism in Europe, it explores the fundamental basis of individual identity. Jung was aware of the growing interest in the study of personality in the fields of psychology and education, particularly in the United States. Jung’s own work of 1920, <em>Psychological Types,</em> was a major contribution to the field, to which both Freud and Adler had added their contrasting input.
Jung’s particular approach is founded on his theoretical understanding of the relationship of consciousness to the unconscious, with its archetypal base. His key insight, parallel with his theory of individuation, is that true personality stems from the personal experience of vocation.</p>

<p class="tit">18. PSYCHE AND SOCIETY</p>
<p class="aut">Mariolina Graziosi</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Date</strong> Friday 26 June, Saturday 27 June</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Time</strong> Friday 7.30-9.30pm, Saturday 10.30am-12.30pm, 2-4pm</p>
<p class="det"><strong>Cost</strong> £105</p>
<p class="aut">Subjects covered:</p> 
<p class="bib">Fundamentals, Individuation, Alchemy</p> 
<p class="det">With the concept of the collective unconscious, C.G. Jung recognized the deep link between psyche and society. Both share the same root: that of the archetypes. As the German philosopher, Theodor Adorno states in his book, <em>Soziologische Schriften,</em> to see society and the psyche as two separate entities means to have a paranoid view. The aim of these seminars is to analyse how, through the archetypes, psyche and society are united. The question of the nature of the psyche will also be addressed: does it have an ontological foundation or it is a cultural product, or both? Finally, the relationship between the archetypes and the concept of the soul, together with their link to culture, will be investigated.</p>
